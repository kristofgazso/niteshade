niteshade Docs
==============

**niteshade** (/ˈnaɪt.ʃeɪd/) is a Python library for simulating data poisoning 
attack and defence strategies against online machine learning systems. The 
library is written in Python 3.10 and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API 
which is heavily integrated with PyTorch's machine learning framework.

For information about data poisoning attacks and why they are a topic of 
concern as well as general information about the project, check out the 
:doc:`about` section. For details regarding setting up and using niteshade, see 
the :doc:`installation`, :doc:`usage` and :doc:`api` sections. Are you a 
cybersecurity researcher or Python developer interested in contributing to 
niteshade? See the :doc:`contributing` section.
