Welcome to niteshade's documentation!
=====================================

**niteshade** (/ˈnaɪt.ʃeɪd/) is a Python library for simulating data poisoning 
attack and defence strategies against online machine learning systems. It is 
primarily a research tool and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

For a brief introduction to data poisoning attacks and why they are a topic of 
concern, see 
`<https://internationalsecurityjournal.com/what-is-data-poisoning/>`_.

Check out the :doc:`installation` section for details regarding getting set up 
with niteshade, the :doc:`usage` section for further information regarding how 
to set up and run a simulation and the :doc:`api` section for detailed 
documentation of the Python API.
